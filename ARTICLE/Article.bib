It is implemented as an add-on package for the freely-available statistical software, R, and includes functions for estimating genetic maps, identifying genotyping errors, and performing single-QTL and two-dimensional, two-QTL genome scans by multiple methods, with the possible inclusion of covariates. AVAILABILITY: The package is freely available at http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/~kbroman/qtl.},

  abstract     = {Although the interval mapping method is widely used for mapping quantitative trait loci (QTLs), it is not very well suited for mapping multiple QTLs. Here, we present the results of a computer simulation to study the application of exact and approximate models for multiple QTLs. In particular, we focus on an automatic two-stage procedure in which in the first stage "important" markers are selected in multiple regression on markers. In the second stage a QTL is moved along the chromosomes by using the preselected markers as cofactors, except for the markers flanking the interval under study. A refined procedure for cases with large numbers of marker cofactors is described. Our approach will be called MQM mapping, where MQM is an acronym for "multiple-QTL models" as well as for "marker-QTL-marker." Our simulation work demonstrates the great advantage of MQM mapping compared to interval mapping in reducing the chance of a type I error (i.e., a QTL is indicated at a location where actually no QTL is present) and in reducing the chance of a type II error (i.e., a QTL is not detected).},

We here propose a merger of genomics and genetics into 'genetical genomics'. This involves expression profiling and marker-based fingerprinting of each individual of a segregating population, and exploits all the statistical tools used in the analysis of quantitative trait loci. Genetical genomics will combine the power of two different worlds in a way that is likely to become instrumental in the further unravelling of metabolic, regulatory and developmental pathways.},
